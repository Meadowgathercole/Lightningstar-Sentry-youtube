  <h2><p>Origns</p></h2>
  <p> My little pony is a t.v show. My Little Pony is an entertainment franchise developed by Hasbro, originally as a toy line for girls.
  The first toys were developed by Bonnie Zacherle, Charles Muenchinger, and Steve D'Aguanno, and were produced in 1981</p>
        <hr />
        <p>         Animator and writer Lauren Faust approached Hasbro, seeking to develop her girls' toys property "Galaxy Girls" into an animated series.
          Hasbro, Inc. has produced several incarnations and lines of toys and entertainment related to the My Little Pony franchise, often labeled by collectors as "generations".
          The animated series My Little Pony Tales which premiered in 1992 was the toy line's most recent television series before Friendship Is Magic, featuring the pony designs of the first toy line.
  Faust was initially hired by Hasbro to create a pitch bible for the show, allowing her to get additional help with conceptualization.
  Faust said she was "extremely skeptical" about taking the job at first because she had always found shows based on girls' toys to be boring and unrelatable.
  My Little Pony was one of her favorite childhood toys, but she was disappointed that her imagination at the time was nothing like the animated shows, in which the characters, according to Faust, "just had endless tea parties, giggled over nothing and defeated villains by either sharing with them or crying".
  With the chance to work on My Little Pony, she hoped to prove that "cartoons for girls don't have to be a puddle of smooshy, cutesy-wootsy, goody-two-shoeness

    Twilight in the beginning of the series isn't interesting in anything except books and studying. When the summer sun celebration came around Twilight was worried about the myth from olden pony times.
    The Mare in the moon, also known as, Nightmare Moon a powerfull princess that wanted to rule equestria and inprisioned in the moon for a thousand years.
    On the longest day of the thousandth year the stars were to aid her in her escape. She was about to return to equestria and bring with her eternal night

    Princess Celestia also mentions Twilight making friends. In the end she defeats Nightmare moon by using something Twilight would never want.
