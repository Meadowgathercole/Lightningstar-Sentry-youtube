<p> Her name is Kayla. She is 21 years old. We all call her Layla. We don't see her a lot ever since she moved out.
  She loves Fortnite, Kingdom Hearts and Assassins Creed. She was a big part of my life until she moved out.
  Kayla moved out in 2016. We still love her even though we never see her. Because of her I look at lesbians and gay men differently.
  Ever since I learned she was lesbian I have looked at her and others like her differently.
  Best Big Sister in the world.
