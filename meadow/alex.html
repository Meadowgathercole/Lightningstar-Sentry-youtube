      <p> His name is Alex. He is 22 years old. We all call him bubba. He introduced me into Minecraft and Kingdom Hearts. He loves Marvel and Wolves. He inspires me to be the best me I can possibly be. \
He has always been there for me. He still lives with my family as of 1/1/19. We all love him so much. He can be a bit of a pain and a stick in the mud, but thats what we like about him the most.
He is always mood changing. He can be mad one minute and making dad jokes the next. Best Big Brother in the World. </p>
