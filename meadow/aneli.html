    <p> Her name is Aneli. We call her Neli for short. She is 12 and still living with my family. She loves gymnastics, Fortnite, Music.ly (tick tock), and anything to do with nail polish.
      She and I are perfect definition of sisters. We fight a lot but we get along a lot. We fight over the stupidest things, but I still love her. She and I love to play outside,
      when I am in the mood. We love to bake together and make dinner for the family. A quick fun story about her is one time we had just finished making cookies and put them in the
      cookie jar. The next thing we all know Neli cuts her hand on the lid of the cookie jar as she drops it because she wasn't supposed to be in the cookie jar. Thats called bad karma. </p>
