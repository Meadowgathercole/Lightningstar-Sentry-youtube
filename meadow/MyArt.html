<h1> My art </h1>
<p>
  I do a lot of art. I draw mostly ponies but I can draw a few other things. Here is the link for my art channels.
For my 16th birthday I got a drawing pad that when I drew on it, it progected what I was drawing on to my computer.
Many people use this sytle today. It saves the hastle of using a mouse and having to undo and redo a lot of mistakes.
I also love to animate things. I don't animate as often as I would like to. Thanks to school I don't have a lot of time to do big art projects.

</p>
<p> This is my very first My Little Pony drawing. She is based on Mal from Disney's Decendants. I designed her to be a part dragon part pony.
  She has the wings, and teeth of a dragon, and the eris' of a dragon. The rest of her body is pony. Her Cutie mark is her mothers symbol
  with a heart in the background. It symbolizes her evil side and her good side. She has green flames on her hooves.
  If you want to learn more about Mal, my character or Disney's.

  </p>
  <p> This is one of my biggest and most deailed drawings. The setting of this drawing is when Lightning had just been attacked and she had to go to the hospital.
    Her friends Crystal Moutain and Emerald Jade came to visit her. Her little sister, my little sisters Oc I made her, Minty Polish is by her side crying.
    Lightning is lieing on the hospital bed hooked up to machines to keep her stable while her wings, horn and all the cuts heal. </p>
